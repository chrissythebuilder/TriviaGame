# TriviaGame

Description: Built a timed trivia game where the user only has 120 seconds to answer 10 questions. The user can only select one answer for each question and once finished, the submit button must be selected where the user is brought to a page where it shows his/her score. If the user did not finish on time then the test will automatically stop to bring him/her to the score page.

Technologies: Javascript used for logic &amp; jQuery to manipulate HTML
